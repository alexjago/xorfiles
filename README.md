# xorfiles
XOR files together - with Rust! 

There's plenty of file XOR implementations out there.  
This one is mine.

# Installation

I don't have binaries available *just* yet so in the meantime you'll want to:

- have recent Rust installed: see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- download this repository whether by git checkout or just downloading zip
- in the project folder, run `cargo install --path .`

# License

Available under the MIT or Apache 2.0 licenses, at your option.
